        My name is <span class="bold-text">Billy Mejia</span>, and I am a dedicated and passionate educator committed to fostering student growth and academic excellence. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Education from the University of California, Merced, where I also earned my Preliminary Single Subject Teaching Credential in Social Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been interested in education and the transformative power of teaching since high school. My instructional approach focuses on fostering critical thinking, civic engagement, and meaningful connections to real-world issues. I strive to create a supportive, inclusive, and intellectually stimulating learning environment for all students.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes designing standards-aligned lessons, facilitating simulations and seminars, integrating technology in the classroom, and adapting instruction to meet diverse learning needs. I am particularly passionate about curriculum design that encourages student voice, inquiry, and active participation.

      <p>
        As an Educator, my <span class="bold-text">philosophy of teaching</span> centers on providing every student with an equitable opportunity to succeed. I believe that education should be inclusive, accessible, and empowering for all learnersâ€”regardless of their background or circumstances. My goal is to foster a learning environment where students feel supported, challenged, and inspired to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academic achievement, I strive to create a classroom experience that students will remember positively. I aim to build meaningful relationships, promote curiosity, and cultivate a sense of belonging. School should be a place where students not only gain knowledge, but also form lasting memories, build confidence, and discover who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a history teacher, I am especially passionate about helping students view the past with fresh eyes. I want to make history engaging, relevant, and reflective of diverse perspectives. I believe in the power of storytelling and historical thinking to help students understand the world around them and their role within it. Ultimately, I hope to inspire an appreciation for the work of historians and the importance of learning from our shared past.
