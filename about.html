        <h2>Philosophy of Teaching</h2>
        <p>
          As an educator, my philosophy of teaching centers on providing every student with an equitable opportunity to succeed. I believe that education should be inclusive, accessible, and empowering for all learners—regardless of their background or circumstances. My goal is to foster a learning environment where students feel supported, challenged, and inspired to reach their full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academic achievement, I strive to create a classroom experience that students will remember positively. I aim to build meaningful relationships, promote curiosity, and cultivate a sense of belonging. School should be a place where students not only gain knowledge, but also form lasting memories, build confidence, and discover who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a history teacher, I am especially passionate about helping students view the past with fresh eyes. I want to make history engaging, relevant, and reflective of diverse perspectives. I believe in the power of storytelling and historical thinking to help students understand the world around them and their role within it. Ultimately, I hope to inspire an appreciation for the work of historians and the importance of learning from our shared past.
